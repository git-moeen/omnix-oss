"""Omnix Eval — automated evaluation of ontology quality and query accuracy.

Overview
========
This module evaluates two dimensions of the Omnix ingestion + query pipeline:

  1. **Ontology Quality** — Does the system create a well-structured, reusable
     knowledge graph? Are entities properly decomposed (address → city/state/zip)?
     Are types connected in a hierarchy? Are predicates consistent?

  2. **Query Accuracy** — Can the system answer natural language questions correctly?
     Does it generate valid SPARQL? Are answers factually correct against ground truth?

Architecture
============
The eval runs in a loop designed for iterative improvement:

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  1. Ingest dataset(s) via CLI                                   │
    │  2. Eval ontology quality (LLM judge scores structure)          │
    │  3. LLM generates questions at 4 difficulty tiers               │
    │  4. Execute each question via /ask endpoint                     │
    │  5. LLM judge evaluates answers against source data             │
    │  6. Report: scores, failures, weak points                       │
    │  7. Fix gaps in pipeline → repeat from step 2                   │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Usage
=====
Via CLI::

    # Full eval: ontology quality + query accuracy
    omnix eval data/listings.csv --kg real-estate --questions 20

    # Ontology quality only (no questions)
    omnix eval --ontology-only --kg real-estate

    # Query accuracy only (ontology already ingested)
    omnix eval --query-only data/listings.csv --kg real-estate

    # Multi-domain test: ingest two datasets, check ontology reuse
    omnix eval data/listings.csv data/restaurants.csv --kg combined

Via Python::

    from omnix.eval import OntologyEvaluator, QueryEvaluator, run_full_eval
    report = await run_full_eval(
        api_url="http://localhost:8000",
        tenant="demo-tenant",
        kg_name="test-kg",
        dataset_paths=["data/listings.csv"],
        num_questions=20,
    )

Question Difficulty Tiers
=========================
The LLM generates questions across 4 tiers to test increasing complexity:

  **Tier 1 — Count/Lookup** (basic aggregation)
      "How many properties are there?"
      Tests: SELECT COUNT, basic entity retrieval

  **Tier 2 — Filter** (WHERE clauses)
      "How many properties have 3 or more bedrooms?"
      Tests: Comparison operators, attribute filtering

  **Tier 3 — Join/Relationship** (graph traversal)
      "Which brokers have listings in Austin?"
      Tests: Relationship traversal, multi-entity queries

  **Tier 4 — Multi-hop/Complex** (chained reasoning)
      "What is the average price of condos listed by brokers in zip 78745?"
      Tests: Multiple joins, aggregation over filtered relationships

Ontology Quality Dimensions
============================
The ontology judge scores 6 dimensions (each 0-10):

  **Decomposition** — Are composite values broken into entities?
      Bad:  Property.address = "123 Main St, Austin, TX"
      Good: Property → located_in → City("Austin") → located_in → State("TX")

  **Reusability** — Are entities created that other datasets would share?
      Bad:  Property.city_name = "Austin" (dead-end string)
      Good: City("Austin") as its own entity (reusable across domains)

  **Hierarchy** — Are types connected via subClassOf, not orphaned?
      Bad:  Broker and Person as unrelated types
      Good: Broker subClassOf Person

  **Predicate Consistency** — No duplicate predicates for the same relationship?
      Bad:  located_in AND is_located_in AND location_of
      Good: Single canonical predicate per relationship

  **Entity-First Compliance** — Are real-world things entities, not literals?
      Bad:  Property.agent = "John Smith" (string literal)
      Good: Property → listed_by → Person("John Smith")

  **Type Naming** — PascalCase, singular, descriptive?
      Bad:  "properties", "LISTING", "real_estate_listing"
      Good: "Property", "Listing"

LLM Judge Design
================
The judge is a separate LLM call that receives:
  - The question asked
  - The generated SPARQL
  - The answer returned
  - A relevant slice of the source data (for ground truth derivation)

The judge does NOT have access to a pre-computed answer key. It derives ground truth
from the source data on the fly. This means it works for any dataset without manual
annotation.

For ontology quality, the judge receives:
  - The full ontology schema (types, attributes, relationships)
  - The source data sample (to understand what was ingested)
  - The 6 scoring dimensions with examples

The judge uses a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1 or Claude Sonnet 4.6) for accuracy.

Report Format
=============
The eval produces a JSON report and a human-readable summary::

    OMNIX EVAL REPORT
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    Dataset:      listings.csv (1000 rows)
    KG:           real-estate
    Model:        deepseek/deepseek-v3.2

    ONTOLOGY QUALITY (45/60)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Decomposition:          7/10  Address decomposed, but phone not
    Reusability:            8/10  City, State, ZipCode as entities
    Hierarchy:              6/10  Broker→Person missing
    Predicate Consistency:  9/10  No duplicates found
    Entity-First:           8/10  Agent is entity, but office is string
    Type Naming:            7/10  "Property" good, "ZipCode" → "PostalCode"?

    Weak points:
      - Property.office_name should be Company entity
      - No Broker→Person subtype relationship
      - Phone numbers stored as strings, not ContactInfo entity

    QUERY ACCURACY (16/20)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Tier 1 (Count):      5/5   avg 1.2s
    Tier 2 (Filter):     4/5   avg 2.1s  ← bedroom filter missed
    Tier 3 (Join):       4/5   avg 3.4s  ← broker relationship failed
    Tier 4 (Multi-hop):  3/5   avg 4.8s  ← avg price + filter + join

    Failed questions:
      Q7:  "How many 3-bed properties under $500K?"
           Expected: 245  Got: 367  (filter not applied)
           SPARQL: SELECT (COUNT(...)) — missing price < 500000
      ...
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Extending the Eval
==================
To add a new ontology quality dimension:
  1. Add it to ONTOLOGY_DIMENSIONS in this file
  2. Add scoring criteria to ONTOLOGY_JUDGE_PROMPT
  3. Update OntologyScore dataclass

To add a new question tier:
  1. Add it to QUESTION_TIERS in this file
  2. Add generation instructions to QUESTION_GEN_PROMPT
  3. Update the report formatting in _format_report()

To change the judge model:
  Set OMNIX_EVAL_MODEL env var (default: uses the same provider as query generation)

ONTOLOGY_JUDGE_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert knowledge graph ontologist evaluating the quality of an \
automatically-generated ontology. You will receive the ontology schema and a \
sample of the source data that was ingested.

Score each dimension 0-10. Be strict. A 10 means perfect, production-ready. \
A 5 means "works but has clear structural problems." Below 5 means "needs \
significant rework."

Dimensions:

1. DECOMPOSITION (0-10)
   Are composite values broken into separate entities?
   Bad: Property.address = "123 Main St, Austin, TX" (flat string)
   Good: Property → located_in → City → located_in → State
   Score 10 if ALL composite values are properly decomposed.
   Score 5 if some are decomposed but others remain flat.
   Score 0 if everything is flat string attributes.

2. REUSABILITY (0-10)
   Are entities created that other datasets would naturally share?
   Cities, states, countries, people, organizations should be their own entities.
   Score 10 if all shareable concepts are entities.
   Score 5 if some are entities but others are buried as string attributes.

3. HIERARCHY (0-10)
   Are types connected via subClassOf relationships?
   Broker should be subClassOf Person. Condo subClassOf Property.
   Score 10 if all natural hierarchies exist.
   Score 5 if some exist but obvious ones are missing.
   Score 0 if all types are flat/orphaned.

4. PREDICATE_CONSISTENCY (0-10)
   Is there exactly one predicate per semantic relationship?
   Bad: both "located_in" and "is_located_in" exist.
   Score 10 if no duplicates. Score 5 if a few duplicates exist.

5. ENTITY_FIRST (0-10)
   Are real-world things modeled as entities, not string literals?
   Bad: Property.agent_name = "John Smith" (dead-end string)
   Good: Property → listed_by → Person("John Smith")
   Score 10 if all real-world references are entities.

6. TYPE_NAMING (0-10)
   Are type names PascalCase, singular, descriptive?
   Bad: "properties", "LISTING", "real_estate_listing"
   Good: "Property", "Listing", "RealEstateBroker"

For each dimension, provide:
- The score (integer 0-10)

4. The ontology schema (types, attributes, predicates available in the graph)
5. Dataset statistics computed from the FULL source data (use these for ground truth)
6. A sample of raw source data rows

IMPORTANT: The expected answer was computed deterministically from the full source \

- "uri_instead_of_value": Returns entity URIs instead of human-readable attribute values
- "none": Answer is correct
- "other": Doesn't fit the above categories

Scoring:
- "correct": Answer matches expected value (within 2% for counts, within 5% for averages/sums)
- "partial": Answer is in the right direction but imprecise or incomplete
- "wrong": Answer is factually incorrect
- "error": System returned an error, empty result, or nonsensical response

For counts, allow a tolerance of up to 2% (to account for minor data normalization \
differences between the CSV and the knowledge graph, such as case sensitivity or \
whitespace). For averages and sums, allow up to 5%. Be lenient on text answers \

GROUND_TRUTH_PROMPT = """\
You are generating a pandas expression to compute the exact answer to a question \
about a CSV dataset. The DataFrame is already loaded as `df` with these columns:

{columns}

Column dtypes (auto-detected):
{dtypes}

Rules:
- Return ONLY valid Python that evaluates to a single scalar value (int, float, or str)
- Use pandas operations on `df`
- For counts, return an int
- For averages/sums, return a float rounded to 2 decimal places
- For text answers, return a string
- Handle NaN/empty values (use .dropna() when needed)
- String comparisons should be case-insensitive where appropriate
- Numeric columns may have been loaded as strings — cast if needed
- When the question asks "which X has the most Y", return the name/label, not a ratio
- When asked for a count, always return len(...) or .count(), never .mean() or ratios
- Match column values exactly as shown in the sample data (case-sensitive unless question implies otherwise)

Example questions and expressions:
- "How many properties are there?" → len(df)
- "How many have 4+ bedrooms?" → len(df[df['bedrooms'] >= 4])
- "Average price of SINGLE_FAMILY in Austin?" → round(df[(df['home_type']=='SINGLE_FAMILY') & (df['city'].str.upper()=='AUSTIN')]['price'].mean(), 2)

      - Concurrent execution: run N questions in parallel (default 10)
      - Question caching: save questions + ground truth to disk, reuse on re-runs
      - Fast judge: programmatic numeric comparison instead of LLM judge

    Args:
        api_url: Omnix API base URL.
        api_key: API authentication key.
